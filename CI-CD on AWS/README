Here we will deploy our app using CodePipeline from AWS instead of Ansible playbook that we used previously. 
CodePipline: 
Orchestrate the whole CI/CD pipeline. It uses CodeCommit, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy each disussed in a separate text file in the current directory. 


Errors Faced:
There's an error with the CA certificate and thus I couldn't connect with the EKS Cluster. I tried to solve it but solutions I found online didn't workout.
