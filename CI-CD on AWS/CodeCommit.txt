Code Commit: 
why code commit and not github?
1- More secure since It's not on a public repo it's on my AWS account.
2- All in one place 

Steps:
1- Create IAM user and don't use root privilege.
2- Create an https key for code commit (download csv file)
3- Create a repo 
4- clone your local repo (get url of repo you created on AWS) 
$ git clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/Yomna-repo1

Enter username and password from the https key created (found in csv file)

Now we have established a connection let's proceed...

5- Push your codes
$ git add .
$git commit -m "first commit"

It's committed locally now push:
$git push

Errors faced and solution: 
1- Origin not found
$git remote add origin https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/Yomna-repo1
$git push --set-upstream origin master
