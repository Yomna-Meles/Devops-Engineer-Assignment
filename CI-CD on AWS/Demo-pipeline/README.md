In this Demo I tried to experiment with CodePipeline. 
Here I am using CodePipeline to deplo a sample app that came across on github. 

Here are the steps I covered to implement this demo:
1- Cloned the github repo and pulled it to my local repo.
2- Created a new repo on CodeCommit 
3- Cloned the new repo 
4- Pushed the necessary app files to the created CodeCommit repo
5- Create a Beanstalk 
6- Create pipeline
