# Devops-Engineer-Assignment

Hi! Welcome to my project.

In this repo I am trying to create an EKS cluster then using apply a sample app using:
1- ansible 
2- Codepipeline (Codecommit, Codebuild and codedeploy)

Each step of the project is contained in a separate directory along with a readme file and screenshots explaining the steps and issues faced.

# Project Summary 
What I was able to accompolish: 
1- Creating an EKS cluster using Terraform 
2- Deploy an app using Ansible 
3- Create a simple demo pipeline 

Obstacles:
1- One of the modules I used to create the EKS cluster had a certification issue but I sloved this issue by using another module 
2- I had an issue with the buildspec file during the build phase (unluckily this issue I still haven't solved)
