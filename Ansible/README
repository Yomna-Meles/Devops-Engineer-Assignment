Hello there again!
So this is the second step of our project. 
We firstly made an EKS cluster (you will find all the needed files and explanation in the AWS K8s Cluster repo) 

Here we will deploy our app using an ansible playbook. 
I used an image of a simple database app you could use any kind of apps it just follows the same concept.

To run the playbook use:
$ansible-playbook <playbookname.yml>
